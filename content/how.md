## How does it work?

Typically a roof must be in good condition to qualify for an upgrade to a Cool Roof. The process works best if a roof is flat, with a parapet around it, and it is free of large machinery or equipment. The [Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC)](https://coolroofs.org/resources/home-building-owners) suggests a variety of different product types to create a Cool Roof. They may be chosen based upon various criteria including weight, cost, and other roof specifications.
